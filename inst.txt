This project is meant to push anti-cheat developers to update their detection logic. This is NOT just for hacking in game.
All codes are open-source (or planned to be), anti-cheat developers can view all code.
If you can see "src_EXT" or similar folder (EXCEPT "src"), you can reference source code in it, but remember to add credit in "credit.txt"
You don't need to verify the code by compiling, since Gradle in this environement is broken, I have to use an external one.
